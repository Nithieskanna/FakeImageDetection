# FakeImageDetection
The purpose of this research is to create a novel image representation architecture that identifies and visually explains the key areas of a forged image that has been created by both humans and machine-generated images, such as GANs, deepfakes and photoshopped images.

The model is trained with DL XceptionNet and XAI.
